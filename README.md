My own take on a well-worn Roguelike Dungeon Crawler style of game.

Lumberjacks are trying to destroy your tree friends (oh no!)

You are a friendly ghost trying to put an end to this madness.

Every level has more bad guys to stop and one big boss. You can collect weapons, health, and other items to help you on this quest. The level is over when you defeat the boss, and are transported deeper into the baddies territory.

Good luck!
